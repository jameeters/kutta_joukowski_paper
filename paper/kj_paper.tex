\begin{abstract}
	The Kutta--Joukowski theorem is an elegant result that characterizes the lifting force produced by an object in a fluid flow. 
	It is applicable to the analysis to airfoils at low speeds.
	This paper presents a derivation of the Kutta--Joukowski theorem --- prefaced by an introduction to the use of complex analysis in analyzing problems of fluid dynamics.

\section{Flows} % (fold)
\label{sec:flows}
	We will be using techniques from complex analysis to examine fluid flow in two dimensions.
	Imagine a 3-dimensional fluid flow which is identical in some sequence of parallel planes.
	We use the complex plane as a cross-sectional slice of this flow, examining one of those planes.
	Imagine a wing of infinite length in a steady wind, so that the flow over each slice of the wing is the same.

	We assume that the flow in in a \textit{steady-state}: that the flow does not change over time.
	We also assume that the fluid is \textit{incompressible}: that the density of the fluid is the same throughout the plane.
	In terms of aerodynamics, this is equivalent to a restriction to subsonic speed regimes.

	\begin{definition}[Flow]
		A \textit{flow} is described by a function $f = u + iv$, which gives the velocity (speed and direction) of a particle at each point in the plane.
		If $z = x + iy$, then $u(x, y)$ gives the speed with respect to the real axis of a particle in the at point $z$, and $v(x, y)$ gives its speed in the along the imaginary axis \footcite{fisher}{84--85}.
	\end{definition}

		
	Now we will introduce a framework for the discussion of curves immersed in the flow.
	\begin{definition}[Tangent and Normal Components of a Flow]
		Let $\gamma$ be a piecewise smooth Jordan curve of length $l$ described by
		\[
			\gamma = \{ z(s) \mid z(s) = x(s) + i y(s), \ 0 \leq s \leq l \}.
		\]
		Then the number 
		\[
			\tau(s) = z'(s) = \frac{dx}{ds} + i \frac{dy}{ds}
		\]
		is of unit modulus and tangent to $\gamma$ at $z(s)$, while
		\[
			n(s) = \frac{1}{i} z'(s) = \frac{dy}{ds} - i \frac{dx}{ds}
		\]
		is normal to $\gamma$ at $z(s)$.

		Then the component of $f$ tangent to $\gamma$ is 
		\[
			f_\tau = u \frac{dx}{ds} + v \frac{dy}{ds}
		\]
		and the component normal to $\gamma$ is
		\[
			f_n = -v \frac{dx}{ds} + u \frac{dy}{ds}.
		\]

		\end{figure}
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Sourceless / Sinkless]
		We call a flow \textit{sourceless} in a domain $G$ if no fluid is created at any point in $G$, and \textit{sinkless} if no fluid is destroyed.
		(For brevity, we will use ``sourceless'' to indicate both of these properties.)

		Let $\gamma$ be any closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve with interior contained in $G$.
		Then $f$ is sourceless if 
		\[
			\int_\gamma f_n(z) \ ds = 0
		\]
		for all $\gamma$ in $G$ \footcite{fisher}{85}.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Irrotational]
		A flow is referred to as \textit{irrotational} if it contains no vortices or eddies.
		Let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise smooth curve in $G$.
		A flow $f$ is irrotational in $G$ if 
		\[
			\int_\gamma f_\tau \ ds = 0
		\]
		for all piecewise smooth and closed $\gamma$ in $G$.
		That is, there is no net movement of fluid along the edge of any closed curve in $G$ \footcite{fisher}{85}.
	\end{definition}


	\begin{theorem}
		Let a flow $f$ be sourceless and irrotational on a domain $G$.
		Then the conjugate $\bar f$ of this flow is analytic on every simply connected subdomain of $G$.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		(Adapted from Silverman \footcite{silverman}{229} and Fisher \footcite{fisher}{86--87}.)
		Consider the conjugate of the flow function: $\bar f = u - i v$.
		For any curve closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve $\gamma$,
		\begin{align*}
			\int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \int_\gamma (u - iv) (dx + i dy) \\
			&= \int_\gamma u\> dx + v\> dy \ + \ i \! \int_\gamma -v \> dx + u \> dy\\
			&= \int_\gamma f_\tau \ ds + i \int_\gamma f_n \ ds
		\end{align*}

		\clearpage

		So we know that 
		\begin{align*}
			\re \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is irrotational}\\
			\intertext{and}
			\im \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is sourceless.}
		\end{align*}
		By Green's theorem, we find that 
		\begin{align*}
			\re \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \iint_{\intr \gamma} \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) dx\ dy 
			\quad = 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is irrotational}\\[1 ex]
			\im \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \iint_{\intr \gamma} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) dx\ dy 
			\quad = 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is sourceless.}
		\end{align*}

		Thus we know that on the interior of any such $\gamma$, 
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &= 0 \implies \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & &\text{when $f$ is irrotational} \\
			\intertext{and}
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0 \implies \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & &\text{when $f$ is sourceless.} \\
		\end{align*}
		Thus $\bar f$ satisfies the Cauchy--Riemann equations in simply connected subdomains of $G$.
	\end{proof}

	Since $\bar f$ is an analytic function, we know by the fundamental theorem of calculus that it must be the derivative of some analytic function.
	We will see that this function has beautiful properties.

\section{The Complex Potential} % (fold)
	\label{sec:complex_potential}

	\begin{definition}[Complex Potential]
	\label{def:complex_potential}
		Let $f$ be a sourceless and irrotational flow in a domain $G$.
		The \textit{complex potential} of the flow is the function $F$ such that
		\[
			F'(z) = \bar f(z) \qquad \text{or} \qquad F(z) = \int_\gamma  \bar f \ ds
		\]
		where $\gamma$ is any closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve in $G$ \footcite{silverman}{230}.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{theorem}
		Let $f$ be a sourceless and irrotational flow in a domain $G$. 
		There exists a complex potential $F$ satisfying definition~\ref{def:complex_potential}.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		(Adapted from Silverman \footcite{silverman}{230}.)
		We know that the integral
		\[
			\int_\gamma \bar f \ ds = \int_\gamma u\> dx + v\> dy \ + \ i \! \int_\gamma -v \> dx + u \> dy
		\]
		is independent of path.
		This implies that the differential forms $u\> dx + v\> dy$ and $-v\> dx + u\> dy$ are exact.
		That is, there exist real functions $\phi$ and $\psi$ of two real variables such that 
		\begin{align*}
			d \phi &= u\> dx + v\> dy \\
			\intertext{and}
			d \psi &= -v\> dx + u\> dy.
		\end{align*}
		This implies the following:
		\begin{alignat*}{2}
			u &= \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x},  \qquad	& v &= \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \\[1 em]
			-v &= \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}, \qquad	& u &= \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \\
		\end{alignat*}
		So that the functions $\phi$ and $\psi$ satisfy the Cauchy--Riemann equations.
		We define 
		\[
			F = \phi + i \psi
		\]
		which implies
		\[
			F' = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = u - iv.
		\]
		Thus $F$ is analytic on $G$ and satisfies the definition of the complex potential.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{remark}
		The proof demonstrates that given a flow we may find its complex potential, but it also implies the converse.
		Given a complex potential $F$ analytic on a domain $G$, we may find a sourceless and irrotational flow function on $G$.
	\end{remark}

\section{Streamlines} % (fold)
\label{sec:streamlines}

	Before we describe streamlines, we must introduce a simple term:\
	\begin{definition}[Level Curve]
		Let $G$ be a domain and $q$ a real-valued function on $G$.
		Given a constant $k$, the set 
		\[
			\{ z \in G \mid q(z) = k \}
		\]
		is called a \textit{level curve} of $q$ \footcite{fisher}{199}.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Streamlines]
		Let $F = \phi + i \psi$ be a complex potential analytic on $G$.
		The level curves
		\[
			\{ z \in G \mid \psi(z) = \mathrm{const.} \}
		\]
		are called \textit{streamlines}.
		Clearly, if $\psi$ is constant along some line, then its derivative must be uniformly zero along that line.
		Thus, along a level curve,
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}dy &= 0 \\
			-v\> dx  + u\> dy &= 0 \\
			f_n &= 0.
		\end{align*}
		So there is no flow normal to the curve, implying that the flow is entirely tangential to a streamline \footcite{silverman}{231}.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{remark}
		For obvious reasons, $\psi$ is referred to as the \textit{stream function.}
		Streamlines describe the paths followed by particles in a flow. 
		Figure~\ref{fig:streamlines} shows the streamlines around an object in a flow.
	\end{remark}

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\input{drawings/streamlines}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\captionsetup{width = 0.5 \textwidth}
		\caption{
			Streamlines around an object in a flow.
			Every particle follows a streamline, no particle ever crosses a streamline.
		}
		\label{fig:streamlines}
	\end{figure}

	The function $\phi$ is less interesting to us.
	It is called the \textit{velocity potential} function because its partial derivatives give the real and imaginary parts of the flow function.
	The level curves of the velocity potential function are called \textit{equipotentials}.
	The the flow $f$ is everywhere normal to an equipotential, meaning that streamlines and equipotentials form a web of orthogonal curves.

	Consider the object in the flow in Figure~\ref{fig:streamlines}.
	Clearly its boundary is impermeable to the fluid --- there is no flow across its boundary at any point.
	Thus the boundary of this object must be a streamline of the flow.
	This means that given the streamlines of a flow, one may find a stream function, and by its conjugate harmonic function, may complete the complex potential whose derivative will give the original flow function \footcite{motteler}{226--227}.

	This is a powerful fact from a computational standpoint.
	Given a model in a wind tunnel, measuring the wind speed at every point around our model would be work-intensive, and would probably disrupt the flow, leading to inaccurate results.
	It is easy, on the other hand, to release smoke into the flow, and thereby track the motion of the air and determine the streamlines by careful observation.
	The methods used in practice are considerably more complicated, but they operate on the same principle \footcite{anderson}{247--256}.

\section{Forces in Fluid} % (fold)
\label{sec:forces_in_fluid}

	There are fundamentally two kinds of force exerted upon an object by a fluid flow: \textit{pressure} and \textit{shear stress}.
	Pressure is the force of the fluid pushing on the surface of the object: it is a force normal to that surface.
	Shear stress is force tangent to the surface of the object, caused by friction between the object and the fluid \footcite{anderson}{15}.
	We will be concerned solely with pressure, we assume that our fluid is \textit{inviscid} and therefore incapable of imparting any shear stress \footcite{motteler}{220}.

	\begin{theorem}[Bernoulli's Law]
		The pressure at each point in a flow is inversely related to the speed of the flow at that point.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		(Adapted from Fisher \footcite{fisher}{251--253})
		Characterizing the pressure exerted by a flow is actually quite simple.
		Newton gives us a simple formula:
		\[
			F = ma
		\]
		which states that the force exerted by fluid in motion is equal to the change in momentum in the fluid.
		We denote the density of a fluid by $\rho$.
		Because we assume the our fluid is incompressible, $\rho$ is constant.
		Note that we are working in two dimensions, meaning that a density is mass per unit area, not volume.
		Similarly, pressure in two dimensions is a force per unit length, rather than per unit area.


		\begin{figure}[H]
			\centering
			\begin{tikzpicture}
				\input{drawings/pressure_rectangle}
			\end{tikzpicture}
			\captionsetup{width = 0.5 \textwidth}
			\caption{
				A rectangle of fluid.
				The dimensions $l$ and $h$ are assumed to be very small.
			}
			\label{fig:pressure_rectangle}
		\end{figure}

		Consider a small rectangle of fluid in the flow, such as that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pressure_rectangle}.
		We will derive the force due to pressure on this small rectangle in the horizontal direction.
		
		We denote the total force at the point $x + iy$ by $p(x, y)$.
		The total force on the small box is the force on its left side minus the force on its right side.
		For small enough $h$ and $l$, we can model this by:
		\[
			h \big( p(x, y) - p(x \tp l, y) \big).
		\]
		This gives the pressure on our rectangle, now we must find the corresponding change in momentum.

		The mass of the rectangle of fluid is
		\[
			\rho \> lh.
		\]
		The acceleration of the fluid is given by 
		\[
			\frac{du}{dt}
		\]
		where $t$ is time.
		But we assume that the flow is in a steady state, so velocity changes only with position.
		Thus
		\begin{align*}
		\frac{du}{dt} &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt}. \\
		\intertext{But we know that $\displaystyle\frac{dx}{dt} = u$ and $\displaystyle\frac{dy}{dt} = v$, thus}
		\frac{du}{dt} &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v.
		\end{align*}
		So the change in momentum in this rectangle of fluid is
		\[
			\rho lh \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right).
		\]

		Equating this to our expression of force, we write
		\begin{align*}
			h \big( p(x, y) - p(x \tp l, y) \big) &= \rho lh \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right).\\
			\intertext{Divide both sides by $lh$ to obtain an expression resembling a derivative:}
			\frac{p(x, y) - p(x \tp l, y)}{l} &= \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right) \\
			\intertext{and take the limit as $l \to 0$ to find}
			- \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} &= \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right).
		\end{align*}
		
		By identical reasoning, we find that
		\[
			- \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} = \rho \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} v \right).
		\]
		
		Because our flow is irrotational and sourceless, we know that $\bar f = u - iv$ satisfies the Cauchy--Riemann equations, meaning that we can rewrite these equations to obtain expressions dependent only upon $x$ and $y$:

		\begin{align*}
			\rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} v \right) + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
			\intertext{and}
			\rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} v \right) + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} &= 0. \\
		\end{align*}
		By integrating each of these we obtain
		\begin{align*}
			\bigintsss \left( \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} v \right) + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} \right) \ dx
			\quad = \quad
			\frac{1}{2} \rho (u^2 + v^2) + p = A(y) \\
			\intertext{and}
			\bigintsss \left( \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} v \right) + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} \right) \ dy
			\quad = \quad
			\frac{1}{2} \rho (u^2 + v^2) + p = B(x) \\
		\end{align*}
		which gives us functions of only $x$ and $y$.
		Setting these two equal to each other, we obtain
		\[
			\frac{1}{2} (u^2 + v^2) + \frac{1}{\rho} p = \mathrm{const.}
		\]
		And because the fluid is incompressible, we can multiply both sides by $\rho$ to obtain:
		\[
			\frac{1}{2} \rho |f|^2 + p = \mathrm{const.}
		\]

		This completes the derivation of Bernoulli's law.
	\end{proof}

\section{Circulation and Lift} % (fold)
\label{sec:circulation_and_lift}

	\begin{definition}[Circulation]
		Let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve forming the boundary of an object in a sourceless and irrotational flow. 
		Then $\bar f  = u - iv$ is analytic in a domain containing $\gamma$.
		Let $\Gamma$ be any smooth closed Jordan curve such that $\gamma \subset \intr \Gamma$, as depicted in Figure~\ref{fig:circulation}.
		Then the \textit{circulation} of $f$ around $\gamma$ is given by:
		\[
			c = \int_\Gamma f_\tau \ ds.
		\]
	\end{definition}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\input{drawings/circulation}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\captionsetup{width = 0.5 \textwidth}
		\caption{
			The circulation around $\gamma$ is given by integration around $\Gamma$.
		}
		\label{fig:circulation}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{remark}
		We know that 
		\[
			c = \re \int_\Gamma \bar f(z) \ dz
		\]
		and that because $\bar f$ is analytic, this integral does not depend on the choice of $\Gamma$, only on the flow (and by extension $\gamma$).

		Because $\gamma$ must be a streamline of the flow, we know that there is no flow normal to it:
		\[
			0 = \int_\gamma f_n \ ds \ = \ \im \int_\gamma \bar f(z) \ dz.
		\]
		Then because $\bar f$ is analytic, 
		\[
			0 = \im \int_\Gamma \bar f (z)\ dz
		\]
		for any closed $\Gamma$ drawn around $\gamma$.
		% The flow is still sourceless.
		% Explain how the circulation can be nonzero in an irrotational flow.
	\end{remark}

	\begin{definition}[Freestream]
		Imagining an object in a flow, it is natural to imagine that far before and far after it encounters the object, the flow is in some uniform state.
		We formalize this idea in the concept of a \textit{freestream}, denoted $f_\infty$, given by
		\[
			f_\infty = u_\infty + i v_\infty \lim_{|z| \to \infty} f(z)
		\]
		\footcite{fisher}{254}
	\end{definition}

	\begin{remark}
		In terms of the physics of flight, the assumption of a uniform freestream should seem quite reasonable.
		Anyone who's flight has been canceled for a thunderstorm should be able to attest to the fact that aircraft tend to avoid flying into areas in which the air ahead of the plane cannot be assumed to be uniform.
	\end{remark}
	% show how a uniform flow => we can have a laurent expansion.

	We now have all the information we need to prove the following:

	\begin{theorem}(Kutta--Joukowski)
		Given an object in a flow with a uniform freestream, we can characterize the lifting force due to pressure on the object in terms of the fluid's density, the freestream velocity, and the circulation around the object.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		(Adapted from Silverman \footcite{silverman}{237--238}.)
		Let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve forming the boundary of an object in a flow $f$.
		Let the flow have freestream velocity $f_\infty = u_\infty + i v_\infty$.
		Assume that the flow is sourceless and irrotational in the domain exterior to $\gamma$.

		We know by Bernoulli's law that the quantity 
		\[
			p + \frac{1}{2} \rho |f|^2
		\]
		is constant along a streamline.
		Thus
		\[
			p(z) = A - \frac{1}{2} \rho |f|^2
		\]
		where $A$ is a positive real constant.

		Consider some small segment $dz$ of $\gamma$.
		The pressure on $dz$ is given by 
		\begin{align*}
			p i \> dz &= \left(  A i - \frac{1}{2} |f|^2 \right) dz \\
			&= Ai \> dz - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \> dz.
		\end{align*}
		
		Let $D + iL$ represent the total force on the object, with $D$ (as in drag) in the horizontal and $L$ (as in lift) in the vertical.
		Obviously the total force on the object is given by the integral around the boundary of the force at each point:
		\begin{align*}
			D + iL &= \int_\gamma p i \ dz  \\[1 ex]
			&= \int_\gamma Ai \ dz + \int_\gamma -\frac{1}{2} \rho i |f|^2 \ dz \\[1 ex]
			&= Ai \int_\gamma 1 \ dz - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma |f|^2 \ dz \\[1 ex]
			&= - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma |f|^2 \ dz.
		\end{align*}

		But we know that $f$ must be tangent to each $dz$ because $\gamma$ is a streamline.
		Hence
		\[
			|f| = \overline{F'(z)}\> e^{-i \theta}
		\]
		where $\theta = \arg dz$.
		Thus
		\[
			|f|^2 = \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \> e^{-2i \theta}.
		\]
		And since $\theta = \arg dz$, it is clear that 
		\begin{align*}
			|f|^2 \ dz &= \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \> e^{-2i \theta} \> e^{i \theta} \\
			&= \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \> e^{-i \theta} \\
			&= \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \ d \bar z.
		\end{align*}
		
		
		Substituting this back into our integral expression for total force yields
		\[
			D + iL = - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \ d \bar z.
		\]
		Taking the conjugate we obtain
		\begin{align*}
			D - iL &= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma \big( F'(z) \big)^2 \ dz \\
			&= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma \big( \bar f(z) \big)^2 \ dz  
		\end{align*}
		Since $\bar f^2$ is an analytic function in the exterior of $\gamma$, the integral is path-independent, and we may replace $\gamma$ by a circle $\Gamma = \{ z \bm{\mid} |z| = R \}$ enclosing $\gamma$.

		Given a uniform freestream we can construct a Laurent series expansion for the conjugate of the flow function.
		We know that $\bar f$ is bounded at infinity, and analytic throughout the rest of the flow, so $\infty$ is a removable singularity of $\bar f$, thus we can write
		\[
			\bar f = \bar f_\infty + \frac{c}{2 \pi i} \frac{1}{z} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{b_n}{z^n}.
		\]
		Now we substitute in the Laurent expansion of $\bar f$ to obtain
		\begin{align*}
			D - iL &= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \bigintsss_\Gamma \left( \bar f_\infty + \frac{c}{2 \pi i} \frac{1}{z} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{b_n}{z^n} \right)^2 \ dz \\[1 ex]
			&= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \> \frac{2 c \bar f_\infty}{2 \pi i} \ \bigintsss_\Gamma \frac{1}{z} \ dz \\
			&= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \> \frac{c \bar f_\infty}{\pi i} \ 2 \pi i \\
			&= \rho c \bar f_\infty i
		\end{align*}
		Thus
		\[
			D + iL = - \rho c f_\infty i.
		\]
