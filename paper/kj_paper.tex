\begin{abstract}
	The Kutta--Joukowski theorem is an elegant result that characterizes the lifting force produced by an object in a fluid flow. 
	It is applicable to the analysis to airfoils at low speeds.
	This paper will present, in full and with explanation, a derivation of the Kutta--Joukowski theorem.
	This will be prefaced by an introduction to the use of complex analysis in analyzing problems of fluid dynamics.

\section{Flows} % (fold)
\label{sec:flows}
	We will be using techniques from complex analysis to examine fluid flow in two dimensions.
	Imagine a 3-dimensional fluid flow which is identical in some sequence of parallel planes.
	We use the complex plane as a cross-sectional slice of this flow, examining one of those planes.

	We assume that the flow in in a \textit{steady-state}: that the flow does not change over time.
	We also assume that the fluid is \textit{incompressible}: that the density of the fluid is the same throughout the plane.
	In terms of aerodynamics, this is equivalent to a restriction to low speed regimes.

	\begin{definition}[Flow]
		A \textit{flow} is described by a function $f = u + iv$, which gives the velocity (speed and direction) of a particle of fluid at each point in the plane.
		If $z = x + iy$, then $u(x, y)$ gives the speed of a particle in the x-direction, or along the real axis, at point $z$, and $v(x, y)$ gives its speed in the y-direction (or along the imaginary axis).
	\end{definition}

	\paragraph*{Curves and Flows}
	Now we will introduce a framework for the discussion of curves immersed in the flow.
	Let $\gamma$ be a piecewise smooth Jordan curve of length $l$ described by $\gamma = \{ z(s) \mid z(s) = x(s) + i y(s), \ 0 \leq s \leq l \}$.
	Then the number $\tau(s) = z'(s) = \frac{dx}{ds} + i \frac{dy}{ds}$ is of unit modulus and tangent to $\gamma$ at $z(s)$.
	The number $n(s) = \frac{1}{i} z'(s) = \frac{dy}{ds} - i \frac{dx}{ds}$ is of unit modulus and normal to $\gamma$ at $z(s)$.

	Now we can describe the components of $f$ tangent and normal to $\gamma$:
	\[
		f_\tau = u \frac{dx}{ds} + v \frac{dy}{ds}
	\]
	gives the component of the flow tangent to $\gamma$ at each point along its length, while
	\[
		f_n = -v \frac{dx}{ds} + u \frac{dy}{ds}
	\]
	gives the component of the flow normal to $\gamma$.
	See Figure~\ref{fig:flow_tangent_and_normal}

	\end{figure}

	\begin{definition}[Sourceless / Sinkless]
		We call a flow \textit{sourceless} in a domain $G$ if no fluid is created at any point in $G$, and \textit{sinkless} if no fluid is destroyed.
		(For brevity, we will use ``sourceless'' to indicate both of these properties.)

		Let $\gamma$ be a closed, piecewise smooth Jordan curve in $G$.
		Then $f$ is sourceless if 
		\[
			\int_\gamma f_n(z) \ ds = 0
		\]
		for all $\gamma$ in $G$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Irrotational]
		A flow is referred to as \textit{irrotational} if it contains no vortices or eddies.
		Let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise smooth curve in $G$.
		The flow $f$ is irrotational in $G$ if 
		\[
			\int_\gamma f_\tau \ ds = 0
		\]
		for all $\gamma$ in $G$.
		That is, there is no net movement of fluid along the edge of any closed curve in $G$.
	\end{definition}


	\begin{theorem}
		Let a flow $f$ be sourceless and irrotational on a domain $G$.
		Then the conjugate $\bar f$ of this flow is analytic on $G$.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		Now consider the conjugate of the flow function: $\bar f = u - i v$.
		For any curve $\gamma$, 
		\begin{align*}
			\int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \int_\gamma (u - iv) (dx + i dy) \\
			&= \int_\gamma u\ dx + v\ dy + i \int_\gamma -v \ dx + u \ dy\\
			&= \int_\gamma f_\tau \ ds + i \int_\gamma f_n \ ds
		\end{align*}

		So we know that 
		\[
			\re \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz = 0 \text{ when $f$ is irrotational}
		\]
		and
		\[
			\im \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz = 0 \text{ when $f$ is sourceless}
		\]
		By applying Green's theorem, we find that 
		\begin{align*}
			\re \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \iint_{\intt \gamma} \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) dx\ dy 
			\quad = 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is irrotational}\\[1 ex]
			\im \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \iint_{\intt \gamma} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) dx\ dy 
			\quad = 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is sourceless}
		\end{align*}

		Thus we know that on the interior of every $\gamma$, 
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &= 0 \implies \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & &\text{when $f$ is irrotational} \\
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0 \implies \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & &\text{when $f$ is sourceless} \\
		\end{align*}
	\end{proof}
