\begin{abstract}
	The Kutta--Joukowski theorem is an elegant result that characterizes the lifting force produced by an object in a fluid flow. 
	It is applicable to the analysis to airfoils at low speeds.
	This paper will present, in full and with explanation, a derivation of the Kutta--Joukowski theorem.
	This will be prefaced by an introduction to the use of complex analysis in analyzing problems of fluid dynamics.

\section{Flows} % (fold)
\label{sec:flows}
	We will be using techniques from complex analysis to examine fluid flow in two dimensions.
	Imagine a 3-dimensional fluid flow which is identical in some sequence of parallel planes.
	We use the complex plane as a cross-sectional slice of this flow, examining one of those planes.

	We assume that the flow in in a \textit{steady-state}: that the flow does not change over time.
	We also assume that the fluid is \textit{incompressible}: that the density of the fluid is the same throughout the plane.
	In terms of aerodynamics, this is equivalent to a restriction to subsonic speed regimes.

	\begin{definition}[Flow]
		A \textit{flow} is described by a function $f = u + iv$, which gives the velocity (speed and direction) of a particle of fluid at each point in the plane.
		If $z = x + iy$, then $u(x, y)$ gives the speed of a particle in the x-direction, or along the real axis, at point $z$, and $v(x, y)$ gives its speed in the y-direction (or along the imaginary axis).
	\end{definition}

	\paragraph*{Curves and Flows}
	Now we will introduce a framework for the discussion of curves immersed in the flow.
	Let $\gamma$ be a piecewise smooth Jordan curve of length $l$ described by $\gamma = \{ z(s) \mid z(s) = x(s) + i y(s), \ 0 \leq s \leq l \}$.
	Then the number $\tau(s) = z'(s) = \frac{dx}{ds} + i \frac{dy}{ds}$ is of unit modulus and tangent to $\gamma$ at $z(s)$.
	The number $n(s) = \frac{1}{i} z'(s) = \frac{dy}{ds} - i \frac{dx}{ds}$ is of unit modulus and normal to $\gamma$ at $z(s)$.

	Now we can describe the components of $f$ tangent and normal to $\gamma$:
	\[
		f_\tau = u \frac{dx}{ds} + v \frac{dy}{ds}
	\]
	gives the component of the flow tangent to $\gamma$ at each point along its length, while
	\[
		f_n = -v \frac{dx}{ds} + u \frac{dy}{ds}
	\]
	gives the component of the flow normal to $\gamma$.
	See Figure~\ref{fig:flow_tangent_and_normal}

		\label{fig:flow_tangent_and_normal}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{definition}[Sourceless / Sinkless]
		We call a flow \textit{sourceless} in a domain $G$ if no fluid is created at any point in $G$, and \textit{sinkless} if no fluid is destroyed.
		(For brevity, we will use ``sourceless'' to indicate both of these properties.)

		Let $\gamma$ be a closed, piecewise smooth Jordan curve in $G$.
		Then $f$ is sourceless if 
		\[
			\int_\gamma f_n(z) \ ds = 0
		\]
		for all $\gamma$ in $G$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}[Irrotational]
		A flow is referred to as \textit{irrotational} if it contains no vortices or eddies.
		Let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise smooth curve in $G$.
		The flow $f$ is irrotational in $G$ if 
		\[
			\int_\gamma f_\tau \ ds = 0
		\]
		for all $\gamma$ in $G$.
		That is, there is no net movement of fluid along the edge of any closed curve in $G$.
	\end{definition}


	\begin{theorem}
		Let a flow $f$ be sourceless and irrotational on a domain $G$.
		Then the conjugate $\bar f$ of this flow is analytic on $G$.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		Now consider the conjugate of the flow function: $\bar f = u - i v$.
		For any curve $\gamma$, 
		\begin{align*}
			\int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \int_\gamma (u - iv) (dx + i dy) \\
			&= \int_\gamma u\> dx + v\> dy \ + \ i \! \int_\gamma -v \> dx + u \> dy\\
			&= \int_\gamma f_\tau \ ds + i \int_\gamma f_n \ ds
		\end{align*}

		So we know that 
		\[
			\re \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz = 0 \text{ when $f$ is irrotational}
		\]
		and
		\[
			\im \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz = 0 \text{ when $f$ is sourceless}
		\]
		By applying Green's theorem, we find that 
		\begin{align*}
			\re \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \iint_{\intrr \gamma} \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} - \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \right) dx\ dy 
			\quad = 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is irrotational}\\[1 ex]
			\im \int_\gamma \bar f \ dz &= \iint_{\intr \gamma} \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \right) dx\ dy 
			\quad = 0 \quad \text{ when $f$ is sourceless}
		\end{align*}

		Thus we know that on the interior of every $\gamma$, 
		\begin{align*}
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial y} - \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} &= 0 \implies \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & &\text{when $f$ is irrotational} \\
			\text{and}\hspace{5 em}&\\
			\frac{\partial u}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} &= 0 \implies \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = - \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} & &\text{when $f$ is sourceless} \\
		\end{align*}
		Thus $\bar f$ satisfies the Cauchy--Riemann equations in $G$.
	\end{proof}

	Since $\bar f$ is an analytic function, we know by the fundamental theorem of calculus that it must be the derivative of some analytic function.
	We will see that this function has beautiful properties.

\section{The Complex Potential} % (fold)
	\label{sec:complex_potential}

	\begin{definition}[Complex Potential]
	\label{def:complex_potential}
		Let $f$ be a sourceless and irrotational flow in a simply connected domain $G$.
		The \textit{complex potential} of the flow is the function $F$ such that:
		\[
			F'(z) = \bar f(z) \qquad \text{or} \qquad F(z) = \int_{z_0} ^z \bar f \ ds
		\]
		where $z_0$ is some fixed point in $G$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{theorem}
		Given a sourceless and irrotational flow in a domain $G$ there exists a complex potential $F$ satisfying definition~\ref{def:complex_potential}.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		Let $f$ be as specified in definition~\ref{def:complex_potential}.

		We know that the integral
		\[
			\int_{z_0}^z \bar f \ ds = \int_{z_0}^z u\> dx + v\> dy \ + \ i \! \int_{z_0}^z -v \> dx + u \> dy
		\]
		is independent of path.
		Thus we know that the differential forms $u\> dx + v\> dy$ and $-v\> dx + u\> dy$ are exact.
		That is, there exist real functions $\phi$ and $\psi$ of two real variables such that 
		\begin{align*}
			d \phi &= u\> dx + v\> dy \\
			\text{and}\qquad &\\
			d \psi &= -v\> dx + u\> dy \\
		\end{align*}
		This implies the following:
		\begin{alignat*}{2}
			u &= \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x},  \qquad	& v &= \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial y} \\[1 em]
			-v &= \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}, \qquad	& u &= \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y} \\
		\end{alignat*}
		So that the functions $\phi$ and $\psi$ satisfy the Cauchy--Riemann equations.
		Thus we define 
		\[
			F = \phi + i \psi
		\]
		which implies
		\[
			F' = \frac{\partial \phi}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x} = u - iv 
		\]
		Thus $F$ is analytic on $G$, and satisfies the definition of the complex potential.
	\end{proof}

	\begin{remark}
		The proof demonstrates that given a flow we may find its complex potential, but it also implies the converse.
		Given a complex potential $F$ analytic on a domain $G$, we may find a sourceless and irrotational flow function on $G$.
		This fact is key to the most beautiful properties of our model of fluid motion.
	\end{remark}

\section{Streamlines} % (fold)
\label{sec:streamlines}

	Before we can describe streamlines, we must introduce a simple term:\
	\begin{definition}[Level Curve]
		Let $G$ be a domain and let $q$ be a real-valued function on $G$.
		Given a constant $k$, the set 
		\[
			\{ z \in G \mid q(z) = k \}
		\]
		is called a \textit{level curve} of $q$.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{definition}(Streamlines and Equipotentials)
		Let $F = \phi + i \psi$ be a complex potential.

		The function $\phi$ is referred to as the \textit{velocity potential}, because its partial derivatives give the horizontal and vertical components of the flow function.
		The level curves 
		\[
			\{ z \in G \mid \phi(z) = \mathrm{const.} \}
		\]
		are called equipotentials, because they describe lines of constant potential velocity.

		The function $\psi$ is called the \textit{stream function} because it describes the paths followed by particles in the flow.
		The level curves 
		\[
			\{ z \in G \mid \psi(z) = \mathrm{const.} \}
		\]
		are called \textit{streamlines} of the flow $f$.
		These lines give the possible paths for a particle in the flow.
	\end{definition}

	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\input{drawings/streamlines}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\captionsetup{width = 0.5 \textwidth}
		\caption{
			Streamlines around an object in a flow.
			Every particle follows a streamline, no particle ever crosses a streamline.
		}
		\label{fig:streamlines}
	\end{figure}

	Since a streamline is a curve along which $\psi$ is constant, $\psi'$ must be uniformly zero along a streamline.
	That is, along a streamline:
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial x}dx + \frac{\partial \psi}{\partial y}dy &= 0 \\
		-v\> dx  + u\> dy &= 0 \\
		f_n &= 0
	\end{align*}
	Thus we find that there cannot be any flow normal to a streamline, implying that along a streamline $f = f_\tau$ the flow is always tangent to a streamline.

	By similar reasoning, we may find that the flow is always normal to an equipotential, meaning that equipotentials and streamlines are everywhere orthogonal to each other.

	Consider the object in the flow in Figure~\ref{fig:streamlines}.
	Clearly its boundary is impermeable to the fluid --- there is no flow across its boundary at any point.
	Thus the boundary of this object must be a streamline of the flow.
	This means that given the streamlines of a flow, one may find a stream function, and by its conjugate harmonic function, may complete the complex potential whose derivative will give the original flow function.

	This is a powerful fact from a computational standpoint.
	Given a model in a wind tunnel, measuring the wind speed at every point around our model would be work-intensive, and would probably disrupt the flow, leading to inaccurate results.
	It is easy, on the other hand, to release smoke into the flow, and thereby track the motion of the air and determine the streamlines by careful observation.
	Personally, I think this is a very exciting fact.

\section{Forces in Fluid} % (fold)
\label{sec:forces_in_fluid}

	There are fundamentally two kinds of force exerted upon an object by a fluid flow: \textit{pressure} and \textit{shear stress}.
	Pressure is the force of the fluid pushing on the surface of the object: it is a force normal to that surface.
	Shear stress is force tangent to the surface of the object, caused by friction between the object and the fluid.
	We will be concerned solely with pressure, we assume that our fluid is \textit{inviscid} and therefore incapable of imparting any shear stress.
	This assumption may seem absurd, but it is pressure that is vital to the production of lift.
	(Shear stress is vital to the production of drag, so we're living in a nice fantasy world here.)

	Characterizing the pressure exerted by a flow is actually quite simple.
	Newton gives us a simple formula:
	\[
		F = ma
	\]
	the force produced is equal to the product of the mass the change in velocity of that mass.
	We denote the density of a fluid by $\rho$.
	Note that we are working in two dimensions, meaning that a density is mass per unit \textit{area}, not volume.
	Similarly, pressure in two dimensions is a force per unit length, rather than per unit area.


	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\input{drawings/pressure_rectangle}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\captionsetup{width = 0.5 \textwidth}
		\caption{
			A rectangle of fluid.
			The dimensions $l$ and $h$ are assumed to be very small.
		}
		\label{fig:pressure_rectangle}
	\end{figure}

	Consider a small rectangle of fluid in the flow, such as that shown in Figure~\ref{fig:pressure_rectangle}, and keep in mind that we will be dealing in close approximations, like physicists, rather than absolute truth, like mathematicians.
	We will derive the force due to pressure on this small rectangle in the horizontal direction.
	
	We use denote the total force at the point $(x, y)$ by $p(x, y)$.
	The total force on the small box, in the horizontal direction is the total force on its left side minus the total force on its right side.
	For small enough $h$ and $l$, we can model this by:
	\[
		h \big( p(x, y) - p(x \tp l, y) \big).
	\]
	This gives the pressure on our rectangle, now we must find the corresponding change in momentum.

	The mass of the rectangle of fluid is
	\[
		\rho \> lh
	\]
	where $\rho$ is the density of the fluid.
	Recall that we assume our fluid to be incompressible, meaning that $\rho$ is a constant throughout the flow.
	The acceleration of the fluid, in the horizontal direction, is given by 
	\[
		\frac{du}{dt}
	\]
	where $t$ is time.
	But we assume that the flow is in a steady state, so velocity changes only with position.
	Thus
	\begin{align*}
	\frac{du}{dt} &= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} \frac{dx}{dt} + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} \frac{dy}{dt} \\
	\text{But we know that } \frac{dx}{dt} = u \text{ and } \frac{dy}{dt} = v, \text{ thus}\\
	&= \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v
	\end{align*}
	So the change in momentum in this rectangle of fluid is given by
	\[
		\rho lh \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right)
	\]

	Equating this to our expression of force, we obtain:
	\begin{align*}
		h \big( p(x, y) - p(x \tp l, y) \big) &= \rho lh \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right)\\
		\text{divide both sides by $lh$ to obtain}\\
		\frac{p(x, y) - p(x \tp l, y)}{l} &= \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right) \\
		\text{and take the limit as $l \to 0$}\\
		- \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} &= \rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} v \right)
	\end{align*}
	
	By identical reasoning, we find that
	\[
		- \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} = \rho \left( \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} v \right).
	\]
	
	Because our flow is irrotational and sourceless, we know that $u$ and $-v$ satisfy the Cauchy--Riemann equations, meaning that we can reform these forces to obtain expressions dependent only upon $x$ and $y$:

	\begin{align*}
		\rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial x} v \right) + \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} &= 0 \\
		\intertext{and}
		\rho \left( \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} u + \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} v \right) + \frac{\partial p}{\partial y} &= 0 \\
	\end{align*}
	By integrating each of these we obtain
	\begin{align*}
		\frac{1}{2} \rho (u^2 + v^2) + p = A(y) \\
		\intertext{and}
		\frac{1}{2} \rho (u^2 + v^2) + p = B(x) \\
	\end{align*}
	which gives us functions of only $x$ and $y$.
	Setting these two equal to each other, we obtain
	\[
		\frac{1}{2} (u^2 + v^2) + \frac{1}{\rho} p = \mathrm{const.}
	\]

	This is the derivation of Bernoulli's law.

\section{Circulation and Lift} % (fold)
\label{sec:circulation_and_lift}

	\begin{definition}[Circulation]
		Let $\gamma$, a closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve, be the boundary of an object in a sourceless and irrotational flow. 
		Then $\bar f  = u - iv$ is analytic in a domain containing $\gamma$.
		Let $\Gamma$ be a smooth closed Jordan curve such that $\gamma \subset \intr \Gamma$.
		This is pictured in Figure~\ref{fig:circulation}.

		The \textit{circulation} of $f$ around $\gamma$ is given by:
		\[
			c = \int_\Gamma f_\tau \ ds.
		\]
	\end{definition}
	\begin{figure}[H]
		\centering
		\begin{tikzpicture}
			\input{drawings/circulation}
		\end{tikzpicture}
		\captionsetup{width = 0.5 \textwidth}
		\caption{
			placeholder.
		}
		\label{fig:circulation}
	\end{figure}

	\begin{remark}
		We that 
		\[
			c = \re \int_\Gamma \bar f(z) \ dz
		\]
		and that because $\bar f$ is analytic, this integral does not depend on the choice of $\Gamma$, only on the flow (and by extension $\gamma$).

		Because $\gamma$ must be a streamline of the flow, we know that there is no flow normal to it:
		\[
			0 = \int_\gamma f_n \ ds = \im \int_\gamma \bar f(z) \ dz
		\]
		Then because $\bar f$ is analytic, 
		\[
			0 = \int_\Gamma \bar f (z)\ dz
		\]
		for any closed $\Gamma$ drawn around $\gamma$.
	\end{remark}

	\begin{definition}[Freestream]
		Imagining an object in a flow, it is natural to imagine that far before and far after it encounters the object, the flow is in some uniform state.
		We formalize this idea in the concept of a \textit{freestream}, denoted $f_\infty$
		\[
			f_\infty = \lim_{|z| \to \infty} f(z)
		\]
	\end{definition}

	\begin{remark}
		In terms of the physics of flight, the assumption of a uniform freestream is less outlandish than it may seem at first glance.
		Anyone who's flight has been canceled for a thunderstorm should be able to attest to the fact that aircraft tend to avoid flying into areas with in which the flow far ahead of the plane cannot be assumed to be uniform.
	\end{remark}

	We now have all the information we need to prove the following:

	\begin{theorem}(Kutta--Joukowski)
		Let $\gamma$ be a closed piecewise smooth Jordan curve forming the boundary of an object in a flow.
		Let the flow have freestream velocity given by $f_\infty = u_\infty + i v_\infty$.
		Assume that the flow is sourceless and irrotational in the domain exterior to $\gamma$.

		If $f_\infty$ is real, then the vertical force on $\gamma$ is given by $-\rho c f_\infty$.
	\end{theorem}
	\begin{proof}
		We know by Bernoulli's law that 
		\[
			p + \frac{1}{2} \rho |f|^2
		\]
		is constant along any streamline of the flow.
		Thus
		\[
			p(z) = A - \frac{1}{2} \rho |f|^2
		\]
		where $A$ is a positive real constant.

		Consider some small element $dz = dx + i dy$ of the curve $\gamma$.
		The pressure on $dz$ is given by 
		\begin{align*}
			p i \> dz &= \left(  A i - \frac{1}{2} |f|^2 \right) dz \\
			&= Ai \> dz - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \> dz
		\end{align*}
		
		Obviously the total force on the object is given by:
		\begin{align*}
			D + iL &= \int_\gamma p i \ dz  \\
			&= \int_\gamma Ai \ dz + \int_\gamma -\frac{1}{2} \rho i |f|^2 \ dz \\
			&= Ai \int_\gamma () \ dz - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma |f|^2 \ dz \\
			&= - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma |f|^2 \ dz
		\end{align*}

		But we know that $f$ must be tangent to $\gamma$ because $\gamma$ is a streamline.
		Hence
		\[
			|f| = \overline{F'(z)} e^{-i \theta}
		\]
		where $\theta = \arg dz$.
		Thus
		\[
			|f|^2 = \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \> e^{-2i \theta}
		\]
		And since $\theta = \arg dz$, it is clear that 
		\begin{align*}
			|f|^2 \ dz &= \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \> e^{-2i \theta} \> e^{i \theta} \\
			&= \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \> e^{-i \theta} \\
			&= \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \ d \bar z
		\end{align*}
		
		
		Substituting this into our expression for total force yields
		\[
			D + iL = - \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma \left( \overline{F'(z)} \right)^2 \ d \bar z  
		\]
		Taking the conjugate we obtain
		\begin{align*}
			D - iL &= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma \big( F'(z) \big)^2 \ dz \\
			&= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \int_\gamma \big( \bar f(z) \big)^2 \ dz  
		\end{align*}
		Since $\bar f^2$ is an analytic function in $\overline{\extr \gamma}$, the integral is path-independent, and we may replace $\gamma$ by a circle $\Gamma = \{ z \ni |z| = R \}$ enclosing $\gamma$.

		Now we substitute in the Laurent expansion of $\bar f$ to obtain
		\begin{align*}
			D - iL &= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \bigintsss_\Gamma \left( \bar f_\infty + \frac{c}{2 \pi i} \frac{1}{z} + \sum_{n=2}^\infty \frac{b_n}{z^n} \right)^2 \ dz \\[1 ex]
			&= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \> \frac{2 c \bar f_\infty}{2 \pi i} \ \int_\Gamma \frac{1}{z} \ dz \\
			&= \frac{1}{2} \rho i \> \frac{c \bar f_\infty}{\pi i} \ 2 \pi i \\
			&= \rho c \bar f_\infty i
		\end{align*}
		Thus
		\[
			D + iL = - \rho c f_\infty i
		\]
	\end{proof}
